HTML, CSS, JavaScript - Unblur Effect Loading - unblurring animation demo web application that gradually unblurs images as they load. Hereâ€™s how it works:

Initial Blur:

When an image is loaded, it starts off heavily blurred, obscuring the details. Users experience a sense of anticipation as they wait for the image to reveal itself.

Progressive Unblurring:

As the image loads, the blur effect gradually diminishes.
The transition from blurry to clear creates an engaging visual experience.

Load Indicator:
Subtle load indicator accompanies the unblurring process. As the blur decreases, the indicator fades, providing a seamless and elegant user experience.

What it looks like (please keep in mind GIF color reproduction and framerate are very limited, I highly recommend downloading and running it for yourself, as the GIF conversion really doesn't do this mini project justice):

1. Download index.html, style.css and script.js files.
2. Put all 3 of them in the same folder (I know it's good practice to use subfolders - I kept it this way for ease of use, which is also why I linked photos online as opposed to local pics.)
3. Click index.html, it should open in your browser, if it doesn't (maybe because your default .html program is a text/code editor) then drag the index.html file and drop it in your browser window.
