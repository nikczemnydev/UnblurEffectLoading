HTML, CSS, JavaScript - Unblur Effect Loading - in my opinion one of the prettiest ways to load some elements on a website.

What it looks like (please keep in mind GIF framerate is very limited, the animation is buttery smooth):

1. Download index.html, style.css and script.js files.
2. Put all 3 of them in the same folder (I know it's good practice to use subfolders - I kept it this way for ease of use, which is also why I linked photos online as opposed to local pics.)
3. Click index.html, it should open in your browser, if it doesn't (maybe because your default .html program is a text/code editor) then drag the index.html file and drop it in your browser window.
